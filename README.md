# casetrack

An automated tracker of cases listed at [USDOJ: Investigations Regarding Violence at the Capitol](https://www.justice.gov/opa/investigations-regarding-violence-capitol).

## Additional

The case files reflect data that is available at the [justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov/opa/investigations-regarding-violence-capitol) webpage. This may be an incomplete listing of cases at any given moment. Some supplemental information (e.g. residency) has been manually added to the case files based on information available at the [Capitol Hill Cases](https://extremism.gwu.edu/Capitol-Hill-Cases) page provided by [GWU's Program on Extremism](https://extremism.gwu.edu/).

## Updates

The tracking script is run every hour to monitor changes and the case files are updated accordingly.
